**Gravitron** is a clone of the minigame *Super Gravitron* from the game *VVVVVV*. The main objective is to survive as long as possible by dodging oncoming debris and objects.

This is a student project I made to practice the entire process of making a game, from preparation to release. Almost everything was self-made, except for the music.
